                The review returns actionable feedback and improvements that can
                be inserted directly into your resume for better results. This
                feedback includes:
                <ul className="pb-2">
                  <li>Bulletpoint improvements & suggestions</li>
                  <li>Format/Content improvements</li>
                  <li>Impact & anti-dilution modifications</li>
                </ul>
                If you're not targetting a Software Engineering role, please
                include the relevant JD/info in the submission so we can tailor
                towards that.
