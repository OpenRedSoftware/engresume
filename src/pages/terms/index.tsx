        <strong>Disclaimer</strong>
      </h3>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude all
        representations, warranties and conditions relating to our website and
        the use of this website. Nothing in this disclaimer will:
      </p>

        <li>
          limit or exclude our or your liability for death or personal injury;
        </li>
        <li>
          limit or exclude our or your liability for fraud or fraudulent
          misrepresentation;
        </li>
        <li>
          limit any of our or your liabilities in any way that is not permitted
          under applicable law; or
        </li>
        <li>

      <h3>
        <strong>Notes on Guarantees</strong>
      </h3>
      Statements made on the website and during advertising assume that
      advertisements are exaggerated to a reasonable amount. As an example, "We
      guarantee more callbacks" requires the user to have made a reasonable
      number of applications both before and after using the service to notice a
      difference. In the event of a significant number of applications made both
      before and after, with callbacks happening both before and after, but with
      no noticible callback rate difference, a refund may be processed.
      <h3>
        <strong>Right to change Terms</strong>
      </h3>
      The Terms of Service on this page may be changed at any time without
      notice. It is the responsibility of the user to check this page for
      changes. If, at the time of purchase, the Terms of Service reflected
      differently, and you have a copy (archive, screenshot, or whatever else)
      proving that, and you believe you deserve a refund based on the Terms of
      Service that were present at that time, please contact us to discuss a
      refund.
